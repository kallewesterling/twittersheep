# TwitterSheep Python Port

Remember TwitterSheep.com and how it used to work? 

Well, I wrote a simple Python port that works the same way (ish). Feel free to suggest changes via pull requests or issues.

The result is a wordcloud like this one (based on [my twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/kallewesterling)):

## Requirements

You have to install a couple of Python packages for this script to run:
- tweepy
- wordcloud
- progressbar
- matplotlib

You can use `pip install` to install all of the packages above (i.e. `pip install tweepy` etc.).

## How-to

### Step 1

Fill in [your Twitter credentials](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html) in `config.py`:

```python
    '''
    Set up your Twitter authentication here.
    '''
    CONSUMER_KEY = "**************************"
    CONSUMER_SECRET = "**********************************************"
    ACCESS_TOKEN = "********-**********************************************"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "**********************************************"
```

### Step 2

Import the TwitterSheep class from the file:

```python
from twittersheep import TwitterSheep
```

### Step 3

Run the TwitterSheep class using the username you want to use:

```python
herd = TwitterSheep(username="kallewesterling")
```

It will take some time when you run the script the first time as it has to download all the data from Twitter, and the `tweepy` package will manage the rate limit for you.

If you don't want to see progress bars while the script runs, you can run it with the `quiet` option set to `True`:

```python
herd = TwitterSheep(username="kallewesterling", quiet=True)
```

### Step 4

Save the wordcloud made from all of your followers

```python
herd.save_wordcloud()
```

Used with no settings, the script will save a 1500x1000 pixel PNG file based on the top 1000 words in the bios from your followers and your friends (the people you follow) to `wordcloud.png` in the directory where you places `twittersheep.py`.

If you want to show words from bios of only your followers (the original intent of TwitterSheep.com), then use the setting `only_followers` set to `True`:

```python
herd.save_wordcloud(only_followers=True)
```

## Customizations

### Saving to a Specific File

Sometimes you may want to save your wordcloud to a specific place. You can do so by adding the option `path` and provide a valid path to the `save_wordcloud()` method:

```python
herd.save_wordcloud(path="../Desktop/my_real_unique_wordcloud.png")
```

Make sure that the path that you're adding the file to exists and that the file ending is `.png` as you will be saving a PNG file.


### Adding Stopwords

If you want to add stopwords to remove certain words from your wordcloudâ€”say, for instance, if you already knew that some keywords would occur but you wanted to make clearer which ones were unexpected.

In the following example, I have chosen to remove a few keywords that I already knew would occur frequently in my follower's bios: theatre, digital, digital humanities, cuny, phd, candidate, phd student, student, and new york. I do so by adding the option `extend_stopwords` to the function and providing it with a list of the words:

```python
herd.save_wordcloud(only_followers=True, extend_stopwords=['theatre', 'digital', 'digital humanities', 'cuny', 'phd', 'candidate', 'phd student', 'student', 'new york'])
```

The result can be seen in the following two wordclouds:

### Getting All The Bios

If you want to see a list of all the bios in your herd, you can do so by accessing the list variables: `herd.friend_bios` and `herd.follower_bios`.

If you want to see all of the bios, you can access them through the list variable `herd.bios`.
